## AI Inventory Management System

Bringing ARIMA Model forecasting to inventory management. 

## Dependencies

Be sure to install pandas, numpy, itertools, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn, and tensorflow. 

You can copy and paste this command to make things easier. 

```bash
pip install pandas numpy itertools matplotlib statsmodels sklearn tensorflow
```

## Setting up the environment:

1. Create a top-level project folder, for example “my_flask_project.”


2. Inside it, make a “flaskr” folder for all your main application code, such as __init__.py, routes, and any database logic. 


3. You can optionally create and activate a virtual environment (by running python -m venv venv and activating it) and then install Flask with pip install flask. 


4. Next, add a “templates” folder for HTML files and a “static” folder for static assets, including a “CSS” subfolder for stylesheets. 


5. Place any primary python files inside the project root
